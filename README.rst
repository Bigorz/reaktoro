Reaktoro is a unified framework for modeling chemically reactive systems. It provides methods for chemical equilibrium and kinetic calculations for multiphase systems. Reaktoro is mainly developed in C++ for performance reasons. A Python interface is available for a more convenient and simpler use. Currently, Reaktoro can interface with two widely used geochemical software: `PHREEQC <http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/>`_ and `GEMS <http://gems.web.psi.ch/>`_.
