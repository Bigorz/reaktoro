Contributing
============

Here at Reaktoro we use the Fork & Pull Request workflow, described here:

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the repository at your machine
3. Add your changes in a branch named after what's being done (`lower-case-with-hyphens`)
4. Make a pull request to `reaktoro/Reaktoro`, targeting the `master` branch

Before starting any change to Reaktoro, we would love to hear about and discuss your idea in a GitHub issue. In this way, we can help ensure that your time will be well spent and your contribution will be accepted.

If you are interested in contributing with the development of Reaktoro but don't know how, please get in touch.
